# Challenge-18-NoSQL

## Description

This is a back-end application that uses NoSQL to store data for an e-commerce site. The application uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM. The application allows users to create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags.

## Installation

To install this application, clone the repository to your local machine and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. You will also need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. 

## Usage

Before running the application you will want to ensure that your databse is seeded by running `node seeds/index.js` . To start the application, run `node index.js` in the command line. From there the user can test their routes using Insomnia.
